changelog for cliff.namodn.com
==============================

03-05-2003 21:11 Rob
	* Added /etc/cron.daily/apt-get_upgrade, a shell script
	  that runs apt-get update and upgrade every night to
	  keep Cliff up-to-date.

03-03-2003 10:39 Rob

	* Added "admin.namodn.com" to Namodn's DNS record.

03-03-2003 10:36 Rob

	* Added "screen", for all your virtual virtual terminal needs.

03-03-2003 9:57 Rob

	* Put this changelog into CVS, added scripts to automate
	  checkout to a passwd-protected admin.namodn.com site 
	  ( just created ).

03-03-2003 9:00 Rob

	* Fixed Apache-SSL config, copied /etc/apache-ssl/httpd.conf to
	  /etc/apache-ssl/httpd.conf-orig, and copied over claire's config
	  to /etc/apache-ssl/httpd.conf-claire

	  Had to read in the VirtualHosts from the old config, and also
	  made some changes so that permissions for things like ExecCGI
	  outside of cgi-bin are set per-vhost, not globally ( did this
	  for iaminsane.com and mail.namodn.com )
	  
  	  Installed perl-suid for OpenWebmail 

03-01-2003 1:34 Rob

	* Re-added deekoo.net 
	  Also, reformatted old changelog entries to be GNU Changelog style

2-28-2003 11:07 Nick

	* Installed vim, because nvi was driving me nuts. Argh!
	  Driving me nuts! It updated some packages, including
	  mkinitrd, and wanted to updated it's conf file, but I
	  said not to. The package maintainers version is there
	  as: /etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf.dpkg-dist 

	  It looks fine, but I didn't wanna take any chances for
	  now.


02-27-2003 21:26 Rob

	* Cliff is installed and up on 63.150.15.11, made him the
	  master DNS server and got rid of Apache warnings ( claire
	  had some CNAMEs, it made some things point back to 209.0.100.49,
	  but cvs.sourcemage.org, which we don't control, is going there
	  too, so it didn't work out for some reason ).

02-27-2003 04:51 Rob

	* installed portfwd-0.26rc6.tar.gz from http://portfwd.sf.net on
	  Claire in preperation for server move

02-27-2003 04:13 Rob

	* syncing cliff before move w/ Rsync, explanation of syntax :
  
  	  #rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /localdir cliff:/remotedir
  	  #
  	  # rsync options used :
  	  # --delete 	this removes files on Cliff that don't exist on Claire
  	  # --archive	makes sure symlinks, perms etc. are the same
  	  # --compress	compresses transfered bits with Gzip
  	  # --rsh		RSH replacement, in this case SSH
  	
  	  the actual commands used ( run from Claire, because Cliff allows root
  	  logins via SSH and Claire doesn't, I don't want to restart SSH on Claire from
  	  remote ), this was used in "claire:/root/finalsync.sh" :
  	
  	  # system/users
  	  rsync --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /etc/passwd cliff:/etc/
  	  rsync --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /etc/shadow cliff:/etc/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /home cliff:/
  	
  	  # web
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/www cliff:/var/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /usr/lib/cgi-bin cliff:/usr/lib/-bin
  	
  	  # mail
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /etc/aliases cliff:/etc/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /etc/exim.conf cliff:/etc/exim/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /etc/exim-aliases cliff:/etc/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/mail cliff:/var/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/spool/neomail cliff:/var/spool/
    	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/spool/minimalist cliff:/var/spool/
  	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/spool/iaminsane.com cliff:/var/spool/
  	
	  # cvs
	  rsync --delete --archive --compress --rsh=ssh /var/cvs cliff:/var

	  made sure partitions on 
	  recreated the RAID with a new /etc/raidtab
	  mkraid /dev/md[0-3] && mke2fs -j /dev/md[0-3]
	  added ext3,scsi_mod,sd_mod, raid1 and md to /etc/modules
	  added ext3,scsi_mod,sd_mod, raid1 and md to /etc/mkinitrd/modules.conf
	  changed ROOT=probe to ROOT=/dev/md0 in /etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf
	  mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.4.18-686 /lib/modules/linux-2.4.18-686
	  changed /etc/lilo.conf to boot off md0 not sda2
	  mkswap /dev/sdb1
	  changed /etc/fstab to use two swap partitions 
	  changed /etc/fstab to use /dev/md[0-3] instead of /dev/sda[2-6]
	  rebooted off raid
	  made home partition mirror ( mkraid /dev/md4 && mke2fs -j /dev/md4 )
	  modified /etc/fstab to use /dev/md4 as home
	  reboot, all is well
	  resync'd namodn data according to : /root/server_move_changelog.txt
	
12-03-2002 04:20 Rob
	
	* d'oh! we're going to have to destroy these filesystems to get
	  the RAID 1 going.
	  first, i umounted /home ( /dev/sda7 )
	  mounted /dev/sda7 /mnt/root
	  mkdir /mnt/root/home
	  mv /mnt/root/* /mnt/root/home
	  made a list of stuff to copy in /tmp/copy.txt
	  find `cat tmp/copy.txt` | cpio -pm /mnt/root/
	  chroot /mnt/root
	  edited /etc/lilo.conf, made /dev/sda7 the root partition
	  ran lilo ( no errors )
	
12-03-2002 03:20 Rob
	
	* copied all the claire:/etc/{passwd.*,shadow.*} files to cliff:/etc/
	
12-03-2002 03:20 Rob
	
	* created journal bits on all filesystems, turned off periodic
	  fscking - tune2fs -j -c0 -i0 /dev/sda{2,3,5,6,7}
	  modified /etc/fstab to use ext3 not ext2
	
12-03-2002 01:23 Rob

	* moved all dns records to /var/cache/bin/orig ( so all 
	  secondary zones would load from claire ), all secondary 
	  zones loaded ok.

	  copied claire:/etc/cron.daily/apache* to cliff:/etc/cron.daily 
	  ( the old deb package provided these, and they used 
	  /etc/apache*/cron.conf as a config file to run [ for example ] 
	  webalizer and any other processing scripts when the logs
	  were rolled. It's not supplied anymore, I guess we'll
	  have to figure something better out in the long run )

12-02-2002 19:01 Rob

	* crap. was wrong about the whole exim/root thing.
	  reverted /etc/exim.conf to the claire version, needs to run
	  as root for the delivery process.
	  edited /etc/cron.d/exim, made it run as root instead of mail

12-02-2002 18:52 Rob

	* copied claire:/etc/webalizer.conf to cliff:/etc/webalizer.conf
	  changed refs in webalizer.conf from "claire" to "cliff"
	  ( this is just for the default server, which we don't
	  use, not really a big deal.. ALL of our hosts are vhosts )
	  had to clean out the webalizer history files so the daily script
	  will run :
	  rm `find /home/ -name "webalizer.current"`
	  rm `find /var/www -name "webalizer.current"`

	  this is due to the upgrade from potato/webalizer to woody/webalizer

12-02-2002 18:40 Rob

	* changed /etc/exim/exim.conf so exim doesn't run as root
	  this is good from a security standpoint, and also because
  	  /etc/cron.d/exim wasn't working ( this runs through the 
  	  queue, very important! )
	  I also had to chown -R /var/spool/exim
	  just tested w/ Mozilla Mail 1.0.1, I can send mail OK through cliff.

12-02-2002 18:15 Rob

	* copied /etc/bind/named.conf to /etc/bind/named.conf_GOOD
	  made /etc/bind.named.conf slave to 209.0.100.49
	  named.conf_GOOD needs to be copied back when cliff goes into service
