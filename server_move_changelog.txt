/* 
*
* changelog for claire->cliff move
*
* started       : 12/01/2002 by Rob
* last modified : 12/02/2002 by Rob
*
* note - every file that existed on cliff before a copy was moved to [file].orig
* , except if it more than one file, like in /etc/bind for example, in which 
* case all pre-existing files were moved to a directory like : /etc/bind/orig/ 
*
* p.s. - we no longer need a special exim dpkg, woody's exim has smtp
* auth support by default! hurray!
*

installed apache, apache-ssl on cliff

installed webalizer
copied claire:/etc/webalizer.conf to cliff:/etc/webalizer.conf
